# Obesity-Prediction-With-R
* Three different machine learning models are implemented to perform a classification task on real dataset.
* Target feature is binary.
* A cross-validation scheme is applied while training and evaluating the model performance.
* Performance of the models are reported by using different evaluation metrics; accuracy, precision and recall.

## Project Report
* Project's details and results are provided in report format:
* Describing the data set, 
* Pre-processing steps, 
* Machine learning models, 
* Parameter tuning, 
* Performance results with plots.
